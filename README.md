# Ride-My-Way
This is the UI design of Andela Ride-My-Way web app
The site allows Passenger to be able to register and login. Once logged in, they can view available ride offers and make ride request if they want.
The drivers can either accept or reject the ride offer made by the passenger and can also create a new ride offer.\
